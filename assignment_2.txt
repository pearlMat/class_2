Dictionaries and Sets
1.
Create a dictionary containing “name”, “city”, and “cake” for “Chris” from “Seattle” who likes “Chocolate”.
Display the dictionary.
Delete the entry for “cake”.
Display the dictionary.
Add an entry for “fruit” with “Mango” and display the dictionary.
Display the dictionary keys.
Display the dictionary values.
Display whether or not “cake” is a key in the dictionary (i.e. False) (now).
Display whether or not “Mango” is a value in the dictionary.
2. 
Using the dict constructor and zip, build a dictionary of numbers from zero to fifteen and the hexadecimal equivalent (string is fine).
3.
Using the dictionary from item 1: Make a dictionary using the same keys but with the number of ‘a’s in each value.
4.
Create sets s2, s3 and s4 that contain numbers from zero through twenty, divisible 2, 3 and 4.
Display the sets.
Display if s3 is a subset of s2 (False)
and if s4 is a subset of s2 (True).
5.
Create a set with the letters in ‘Python’ and add ‘i’ to the set.
Create a frozenset with the letters in ‘marathon’
display the union and intersection of the two sets.

Exceptions
Improving input

The input() function can generate two exceptions: EOFError or KeyboardInterrupt on end-of-file(EOF) or canceled input.
Create a wrapper function, perhaps safe_input() that returns None rather rather than raising these exceptions, when the user enters ^C for Keyboard Interrupt, or ^D (^Z on Windows) for End Of File.

write a program which prints the full path to all files in the current directory, one per line
write a program which copies a file from a source, to a destination (without using shutil, or the OS copy command)

write a full set of letters to everyone to individual files on disk
see if you can use a dict to switch between the users selections
Try to use a dict and the .format() method to do the letter as one big template – rather than building up a big string in parts.
